### First Steps of AI
Andrew Ng himself learned coding when he was 5 years old. 
> Even the way I think about Machine learning today were very good at writing algorithms that can automate things that people do.

### Early Days of Online Education
Andrew Ng tried to make everything as clear as a bright water.
Many Machine Learning engineers started learning ML with the Machine Learning Course from Coursera. 

Vast majority of software engineers (Which I call them the traditional developers, also Version 1 Developers) are sort of appreciated the cloud system, design. In the future, he tells that a vast majority of software developers will appreciate AI and use AI.

> *AI is the new Electricity* ~ Andrew Ng

Once upton a time, only a small part of humanity was literate (knowing how to read, write). People didn't need to know how to read and write, because the monks that were literate could tell them. But once we gived literacy to almost everyone, it dramatically enhanced human to human interactions. 

For Andrew Ng, in computing, we are also in the same phase as the literacy. It will enhance human to computer communications which is becoming more and more important.
> Society is the new phase of literacy


### Pieter Abbeel and Early Research at Stanford
Many things did not go well while they were doing their research on Reinforcement Learning to fly helicopter. 

Andrew Ng likes to do things, researches to influence and to help people and humanity. 

**Working with maths:** His math professor likes to do maths because he loves the truth in the nature

**Machine Learning**: Kind of applied math where you use the *math* to influence and help the humanity.

### Early Deeps of Deep Learning:
Andrew Ng and his team put a lot of effort on Unsupervised Learning.
>“If intelligence is a cake, the bulk of the cake is unsupervised learning, the icing on the cake is supervised learning, and the cherry on the cake is reinforcement learning (RL).” ~ Yann Lecun

It is challenging to **create your own dataset** rather than collecting dataset from trusted websites. 

### deeplearning.ai: How To Get Started In Machine Learning
deeplearning.ai provides courses for people that wants to get into Deep Learning.

*How does one get started in deep learning and where does deeplearning.ai fit into that?*
There are many DL concepts introduced in the course
Prerequisits are programming backgroung, and high school math would be efficient.

Key concepts in the course are:
* You will know how to train a Neural Network
* There will be practical examples of theory
* Deep Learning Diagnostics
  * Debugging Deep Learning will be very helpful when you have an error
